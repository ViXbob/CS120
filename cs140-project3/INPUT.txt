You're amazing!
You're awesome!
And by the way, TAG, you're it.
As amazing and awesome as you already are,
you can be even more so.  
Beautiful young people are the whimsey of nature,
but beautiful old people are true works of art.    
But you don't become "beautiful" just by virtue of the aging process.
